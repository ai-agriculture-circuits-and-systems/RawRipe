# RawRipe Dataset

A comprehensive dataset of fruit images in both raw and ripe states, designed for fruit maturity recognition tasks. The dataset includes images of 10 different fruit types, enabling various classification approaches from agricultural, market, and automation perspectives.

## Dataset Description

The RawRipe Dataset contains images of fruits in both raw and ripe states, collected for research in fruit maturity recognition. This dataset is specifically designed for computer vision and deep learning applications in agricultural detection and classification tasks.

### Data Summary

The dataset includes 10 types of fruits:
- Apple
- Banana
- Coconut
- Guava
- Litchi
- Mango
- Orange
- Papaya
- Pomegranate
- Strawberry

Each fruit is represented in both raw and ripe states.

## Applications

This dataset can be used to solve three types of classification problems:

1. Raw vs Ripe for a specific fruit (agricultural perspective)
2. Raw vs Ripe for any fruit (market perspective)
3. Multi-class/label classification (automation perspective)
